# Retail Transactions Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes retail transaction and product data using Python. 
The goal is to uncover sales trends, product performance, and the impact of discounts through data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

## Datasets
- **Transactions Dataset**: Contains household level purchase data including quantity, sales value, discounts, and weekly timing.
- **Products Dataset**: Contains product metadata such as department, brand, commodity, and size.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab
- GitHub

## Key Analysis Steps
- Data loading and validation
- Data cleaning and handling missing values
- Dataset merging and feature engineering
- Exploratory data analysis
- Visualization of trends and product performance

## Visualizations
- Weekly sales trends
- Top products by revenue
- Top products by quantity sold
- Discount impact analysis

## Key Findings
- Sales and quantity varied week to week, indicating possible seasonality.
- A small group of products generated the majority of revenue.
- High sales volume did not always correspond to high revenue.

## How to Run the Project
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Upload the Excel datasets
3. Run cells in order from top to bottom

## Future Improvements
- Add time series forecasting
- Segment customers by purchasing behavior
- Build interactive dashboards using Plotly
